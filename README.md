# Buyable-Shells

![Stable Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.0.0-brightgreen)

The mod adds the ability to buy shotgun shells for 20 credits in shop. **You can use it as server or client side** - but if you use it with connect to other servers (that have not this mod) - you can see a bug, in this case delivery rocket cant be opened, when in order there are only Shells.

In perfect case - client and server should install this mod already for correct working.
